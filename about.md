# About Me

<span class="drop-cap">I</span> am a second-year student at Washington University in St. Louis studying electrical engineering. I hail from Manhattan, NYC, and when I am home you may find me attempting to discover some nook or cranny of Central Park that I am yet to see before. I find the emergence of complex behaviour from simple rules fascinating, particularly within cellular automata and chaotic systems. In the future I will write more about this topic.

For better or worse, I inhabit a corporeal form beyond this keyboard. I am on WashU's rowing team, which functions as a means to reset my brain every morning. It is admittedly a slightly strange sport, and it takes quite a lot of dedication to move a boat 2,000 meters in a respectable time. As a result, you will find me in bed by 8:30 p.m. most week days. I promise it's fun.

If you find me interesting, consider connecting with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-theiler-485b41289/), sending me an [email](mailto:s.k.theiler@wustl.edu), or, if you're feeling particularly generous, [offering me a job or internship](/assets/files/resume.pdf).

# About This Site

This site intends to serve as a collection for my various projects and musings. I make no promise to update it regularly. Once upon an ancient time, I ran a [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@sebastiankt9) with some explainers for various topics in machine learning. One day I may port those blogs here with some much needed updates.

I briefly considered writing this site in some fancy cutting-edge JavaScript framework. [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/), and several others were under consideration. Perhaps [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for managing my posts. However, I am ultimately rather pressed for time and would like to dedicate as little effort as possible to updating the site as web standards evolve. This goal is impossible to meet fully, but I think it can at least be approximated by simplifying the tech stack as much as one reasonably can and no further. For that reason, I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and, the most durable file format humanity is yet to invent, plain text, as the most humble solution. It is hosted through [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and its source code can be found [here](https://github.com/sebtheiler/sebtheiler.github.io/).
